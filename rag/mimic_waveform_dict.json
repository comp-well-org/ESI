The wide QRS complexes indicate ventricular origin of the tachycardia rhythm. The QRS duration is 0.12 seconds or more. The morphology of wide QRS complexes can vary across leads, with some leads showing a predominant R wave, others showing a predominant S wave, and some showing an initial Q wave or notched R/S waves.", "Wide complex tachycardia": "Wide complex tachycardia typically shows a wide QRS complex, often with a bizarre morphology. The QRS complexes appear wide and abnormal, often varying in shape and amplitude across different leads. There may be capture beats with a normal QRS morphology interspersed among the wide, abnormal complexes. Fusion beats with an intermediate morphology between normal and wide complex may also be present.", "Wide-QRS tachycardia": "Wide QRS complexes with varying morphologies, including some narrow QRS complexes interspersed (capture beats) and intermediate complexes (fusion beats). The QRS duration is 0.12 seconds or more. Leads may show predominantly positive QRS complexes (monophasic), biphasic QRS complexes (e.g. qR, rS), or more bizarre patterns. The rhythm is typically irregular and rapid, often over 100 bpm.", "Within normal limits for age": "Normal sinus rhythm:\nRhythm is regular.\nRate is 60 to 100 beats per minute.\nP waves are normal in size, shape, and direction. They are positive in lead II (a positive lead). One P wave precedes each QRS complex.\nPR interval is normal (0.12 to 0.20 second).\nQRS complex is normal (0.10 second or less).", "Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern type B": "In type B Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern, the delta wave is negative in lead V1. There is also a pseudoinfarct pattern present in leads III, aVF, and V1, which can mimic an anterior myocardial infarction or a left bundle branch block.", "rSr' pattern in V1 or V2": "The rSr' pattern in leads V1 or V2 typically shows a small initial r wave, followed by a taller S wave, and then a terminal r' wave (rSr' pattern). In lead V1, the R' is usually taller than the initial r wave. In lead V2, the R' may be equal to or slightly smaller than the initial r wave.", "rSr'(V1) - probable normal variant": "The potential ECG waveform for the condition of rSr' (V1) - probable normal variant would show a small initial positive deflection (r wave) followed by a deep negative deflection (S wave), and then another positive deflection (r' wave) in lead V1. This pattern represents a normal variant and is not indicative of any pathological condition. The remaining leads may appear normal or show minor variations within normal limits.", "with fusion complexes": "With fusion complexes, the ECG waveform typically shows QRS complexes with an intermediate morphology between a normal QRS and a premature ventricular complex (PVC). The QRS complex appears wider than normal but narrower than a typical PVC. The amplitude or height of the QRS complex is between that of a normal beat and a PVC. The morphology varies across different leads, reflecting the fusion of ventricular activation from both the normal conduction pathway and the ectopic PVC focus.", "with fusion complexes or aberrant ventricular conduction": "The ECG waveform for fusion complexes or aberrant ventricular conduction typically shows a hybrid QRS complex morphology, with features of both normal and abnormal ventricular depolarization patterns. The QRS complex may appear wide and bizarre, with an initial vector resembling the normal QRS complex, followed by a terminal portion that deviates from the typical pattern. The degree of fusion or aberrancy can vary across different leads, with some leads exhibiting more pronounced abnormalities than others.", "with fusion complexes with PAC(s)": "With fusion complexes involving premature atrial contractions (PACs), the ECG waveform may show a hybrid QRS complex that is intermediate in morphology between the normal QRS and the aberrantly conducted PAC beat. The initial part of the QRS complex resembles the normal supraventricular QRS, while the terminal portion takes on characteristics of the aberrant ventricular depolarization from the PAC. The degree of fusion depends on the relative timing between the sinus and ectopic impulses. In the precordial leads, the initial R wave may be taller than normal, followed by an abnormal S wave or slurred downstroke of the R wave."}
